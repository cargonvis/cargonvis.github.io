                    <p><i class="fas fa-university"></i> <strong>Institution:</strong> Maynooth University, Ireland</p>
                    <p><i class="fas fa-book"></i> <strong>Field of Study:</strong> Electronics and Computing Sciences</p>

                    <p><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> <strong>Description:</strong> </p>

                    <p>Upon starting my master's at Maynooth University, I built upon my foundational knowledge from my undergraduate studies, delving deeper 
                        into the realms of robotics and embedded AI. The program is designed to bridge computing, electronics, and mechanical engineering, 
                        equipping me with the specialized skills necessary to design and control intelligent machines.</p>

                    <p>The curriculum included courses in core areas such as Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning & Neural Networks, Artificial Intelligence 
                        & Language Processing, and Deep Learning. These courses advanced my understanding of AI, particularly in its application to robotics. 
                        My learning extended to practical topics like Introduction to Control Theory for Robotics and Autonomous Mobile Robotics, where I 
                        explored the principles underlying robot movement and autonomy.</p>
                    
                    <p>I also focused on the intersection of robotics and human interaction through courses like Human-Robot Interaction and 3D Vision and 
                        Augmented Reality. These modules provided insights into the ethical and practical challenges of designing robots that can 
                        seamlessly integrate into human environments.</p>
                    
                    <p>The program emphasized teamwork and innovation, with a major team project each semester. In the first semester, my team and I 
                        concentrated on robot design and innovation, applying design thinking methodologies. The second semester’s project shifted 
                        towards system realization and evaluation, allowing us to bring our designs to life and test their functionality in real-world 
                        scenarios.</p>
                    
                    <p>My master’s thesis will be a culmination of these experiences, conducted in partnership with either an industry leader <!--like Eiratech 
                        Robotics--> or within Maynooth’s robotics research group. This project will demonstrate my ability to apply advanced AI techniques 
                        to solve complex problems in robotics, solidifying my expertise in embedded AI systems.</p>
                
                    <p>Upon graduation, I will have gained not only deep technical knowledge in robotics and AI but also invaluable experience in innovation, 
                        teamwork, and the practical application of cutting-edge research in real-world scenarios.</p>

                    <p><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i> <strong>Duration:</strong> August 2020 - August 2023</p>
                    <p><i class="fas fa-university"></i> <strong>Institution:</strong> Satakunta University of Applied Sciences (SAMK), Finland</p>

                        <p>When I started my journey at SAMK, I had no prior experience in programming, but I quickly fell in love with AI and robotics. 
                            My Bachelor of Engineering in Data Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence provided me with a comprehensive 
                            foundation.</p>

                        <p>The curriculum included foundational courses like Basic Developer Tools and Version Control (UNIX commands and basics of Git), GIT Open, 
                            Linux Basics, and Container Technologies (using Docker). I progressed through programming courses such as Programming Basics 
                            (using Python), Python Programming, AI Programming (also using Python), Object-Oriented Programming (using C#), C++ Programming, 
                            C Programming, Embedded C/C++ Programming, and an IoT course.</p>
                        
                        <p>In web development, networks, and cloud computing, I took courses like Introduction to Networks, Web Development Basics (HTML and CSS), 
                            and Cloud Computing and GPUs (using Azure and Google Colab). My database courses included Relational Databases, Database Programming, 
                            Big Data, and NoSQL Databases. I worked with MariaDB, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, Redis, and Neo4j.</p>
                        
                        <p>I gained extensive knowledge in data analysis, covering data acquisition, cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis using AI tools. This 
                            solidified my ability to efficiently harness AI for practical data solutions.</p>
                        
                        <p>In AI, I studied Machine Learning, Neural Network Models, Machine Vision and Convolutional Neural Networks, and Natural Language 
                            Processing (NLP). These courses deepened my understanding of AI, enabling me to develop sophisticated models and applications.</p>
                    
                        <p>Robotics was a significant part of my studies, with courses such as Robotics, Open Source Robot Platforms (ROS), Mechatronics and 
                            Robot Programming, and participation in an international week in Belgium focused on programming drones using ROS.</p>
                        
                        <p>My bachelor's thesis, titled "Deep Learning EEG-based Motor Imagery System for Robot Control using 3D Printed Headset and Electrodes", 
                            showcases my commitment to merging AI with practical applications. The project involved designing and implementing an EEG-based 
                            motor imagery system to control a robot arm using a 3D printed headset and electrodes. This research demonstrated the potential 
                            of custom EEG headsets and deep learning models in creating reliable and user-friendly robot control systems.</p>
